# NutriAI - Customized Nutrition Recommendation System

## Overview:
Develop a web application that uses OpenAI's API to provide personalized nutrition recommendations based on a user's dietary preferences, health goals, and lifestyle. The application should consider factors such as allergies, food restrictions, and nutrient requirements to suggest meal plans and recipes tailored to the user's needs.

## Features:
- User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles that include information about their age, gender, weight, height, activity level, dietary preferences, allergies, and health goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, or general health improvement).
- Meal Planning: Use OpenAI's API to generate meal plans that meet the user's nutrient goals and dietary preferences. The application should provide a variety of meal options, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, as well as portion sizes for each meal.
- Recipe Recommendations: Use OpenAI's API to generate recipes that meet the user's nutrient goals and dietary preferences. The application should provide a variety of recipe options, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, as well as portion sizes for each meal.
<!-- - Nutrient Tracking: Allow users to track their daily nutrient intake and compare it to their recommended nutrient goals. The application should provide a visual representation of the user's nutrient intake, including a breakdown of macronutrients (e.g., carbohydrates, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals). -->
